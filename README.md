## 3. Running Image Analysis
### 3.1. Pre-processing
Fiji Scripts for pre-processing have been included for convenience. Alternatively, save image stacks as single 8-bit images in a folder labelled 'actin' (fixed data) or '<4-digit-index>/actin' (live data).

**Live Images**

Splits live movies for each x-y position into a folder (eg. '0001/actin', '0002/actin', ...).

**Fixed Images**

Splits image stacks into folder labelled 'actin'. Converts images to 8-bit and enhance brightness/contrast.

###  3.2. Actin Segmentation
Segmentation of radial fibres using ResNet-50

Install dependencies:
```
cd Actin_segmentation  # Path is just an example
conda create -n new_environment python=3.6  -y
conda activate new_environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install tensorflow=1.14.0 --y
```

Open actin_predict.ipynb using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. 
```bash
jupyter lab
```
Note: ensure that the pre-process steps have been completed.
