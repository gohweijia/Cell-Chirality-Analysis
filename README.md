# Cell-Chirality-Analysis
Code used for publication

Input images: 512 x 512 pixels images of single cells patterned on 1800Âµm<sup>2</sup> micro-patterns. 

## Pre-processing
Fiji Scripts for pre-processing have been included for convenience. Alternatively, save image stacks as image sequence using Fiji in a folder labelled 'actin' (fixed) or '<4-digit-index>/actin' (live).

**Live Images**

Splits live movies for each x-y position into a folder (eg. '0001/actin', '0002/actin', ...).

**Fixed Images**

Splits image stacks into folder labelled 'actin'. Converts images to 8-bit and enhance brightness/contrast.
